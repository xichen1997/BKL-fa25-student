    "In the earlier part of the homework, we calculated the Average Model Win-Rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this method is not ideal for our use case where battle counts per model are not equal. For instance, if ChatGPT-4o-latest battled more often with weaker models, it would have a high win rate without being an actually stronger model. Now let's explore how we can instead *learn* these model strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To recap,** we want to construct a leaderboard by assigning a strength score $S_m$ to each model $m \\in \\{1,...,M\\}$, such that:\n",
    "- The ranking reflects the probability of one model winning against another.\n",
    "- For any pair of models A and B, the probability that A beats B, should depend on the *difference* in their strengths: $S_A - S_B$. Why the difference? Since we are measuring pairwise preference, there is no absolute measure of strength but rather a model's strength *relative* to other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formally, we want a function $f$ such that**\n",
    "- For models A and B with scores $S_A$ and $S_B$, we want:\n",
    "  $$ P(\\text{A beats B}) = f(S_A - S_B) $$\n",
    "- The function $f$ should be increasing (bigger skill gap, higher win chance), and always output a probability between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, a natural question is: what should we choose for the function $f$? A standard and effective choice is the logistic (sigmoid) function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{A beats B}) = \\sigma(S_A - S_B) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(S_A - S_B)}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this is exactly the same form as logistic regression, where the model scores are the parameters to be learned. In other words, learning model strengths from pairwise outcomes is equivalent to fitting a logistic regression model to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can use logistic regression to learn the model strengths that best explain the observed battle outcomes. The higher a model's score, the more likely it is to win against others. The methodology is called the [Bradley-Terry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley%E2%80%93Terry_model) model and is the underlying theory to other common scoring systems like ELO ratings."

    "However, when comparing model scores, it's important to understand not just the average performance, but also how much uncertainty there is in our estimates. Our rankings are based on a finite sample of battles, and if we had collected a different set of match-ups, the resulting scores could be different. This sampling variability means that our estimated model strengths are subject to noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping is a powerful, intuitive way to assess this uncertainty without making strong assumptions about the underlying data. By repeatedly resampling our observed battles (with replacement) and retraining the model on each resampled dataset, we simulate what might have happened if we had observed a slightly different set of battles. For each resample, we get a new set of model scores. By looking at the distribution of these bootstrapped scores, we can estimate confidence intervals for each model's strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, bootstrapping helps us answer: \"If we repeated this evaluation process many times, how much could each model's score vary just due to random chance in which battles we happened to observe?\" This gives us a more honest sense of which differences in model scores are robust, and which might just be due to luck."

    "**Task:** \n",
    "Now, just like the `refusal_count` feature we created above, implement new functions that can extract any stylistic features from the conversations.  \n",
    "- Define a function that computes the normalized difference for a feature of your choice (e.g., presence of certain phrases, punctuation, formatting). You can check multiple different phrases if you want, they just to have a common \"theme\" - similar to the last problem of the previous part of this homework.   \n",
    "- Apply this function to each row in the dataset.  \n",
    "- Store the results in a new column of `selected_battles_no_ties[\"YOUR_FEATURE\"]`. \n",
    "- Plot the change in ranking and style coefficients and the existing style features along with your custom feature. **To get full points, your feature needs to get a higher magnitude coefficient [abs(Average Score)] than `style_header_count`**. It is okay if the confidence intervals overlap or if your coeffieinct is negative, as long as the absolute value is higher. \n",
    "- You cannot use a feature already explored or anything similar (e.g. you can't have an \"I refuse\" style feature or a word count style feature). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is open ended, you don't need to use the features you found above, get creative with it! Heck, you can even throw response pairs into your LLM of choice and ask it to come up with differences just like VibeCheck! "
