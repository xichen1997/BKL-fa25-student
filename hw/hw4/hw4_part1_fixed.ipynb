    "# Subpart 1: Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's warm up by building a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) in PyTorch to get familiar with the PyTorch library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So what is PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is a powerful Python library for building and training neural networks. It is built around data structures called tensors (multi-dimensional arrays!). PyTorch is awesome because it handles creating computational graphs and calculating gradients for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PyTorch Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch's main building block are *modules*, which you can think of as different layers in your neural net. PyTorch has a couple of pre-defined classes which inherit from the base `nn.Module` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules can be as simple as individual layers:\n",
    "* [Linear fully-connected layer](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "... activation functions:\n",
    "* [ReLU](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ReLU.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "... entire blocks of a model, which often have *other* modules inside of them!\n",
    "* [LSTM/long short-term memory blocks](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LSTM.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "... or complete models!\n",
    "* [Transformer - we'll be implementing our own version later in this homework](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Transformer.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, you can think of modules as LEGO bricks that you can piece together in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementing custom `nn.Module` subclasses!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also define our own classes that inherit from the `nn.Module` base class! To implement your own subclass of `nn.Module`, you need to define 2 methods:\n",
    "* `__init__(self, ...)`: The constructor method where you initialize all the layers and parameters your module will use. Call super().__init__() first to properly initialize the parent nn.Module class. Define any layers (e.g., Conv2d, Linear, etc.) as instance attributes here. PyTorch will automatically track these as submodules and register their parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `forward(self, x)`: Defines the forward pass computation. Takes input tensor(s) and returns output tensor(s). This is where you specify how data flows through your layers—apply operations, activations, skip connections, etc. You call your model with output = model(input), which internally invokes the forward method. PyTorch's autograd automatically builds the backward pass from your forward operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PyTorch Functionals\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important part of PyTorch is `torch.nn.functional`. This is a module (note: \"module\" in this case refers to a sublibrary of a Python library. It's not the same thing as the `Module` classes we were just talking about! I know, it's confusing!) of stateless functions, which means that these functions perform operations on tensors without maintaining any state or tracking parameters. So these don't contain learnable parameters we can train and update. `torch.nn.functional` is often imported as `F`; in practice you'll often see it being called like this: `F.relu(x)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, certain kinds of layers have both `nn.Module` and `nn.functional` implementations in PyTorch. How do you know when to use which kind? As a rule of thumb, whenever you need to the layer's parameters to be learnable (i.e. changeable over the course of training), use the `nn.Module` version. On the other hand, for operations like activation functions (e.g. ReLU or TanH) we don't have any parameters that we can learn! So their `nn.Module` and `nn.functional` version can be used interchangeably. In your code below, you can choose to use either `nn.ReLU` or `F.relu`.\n",

    "|----------|-----------------|---------------|\n",
    "| State | Stateful - maintains parameters | Stateless - just functions|\n",

    "For this assignment, we'll use a \"mini\" version of ImageNet-1k from HuggingFace, which contains 100 of the original 1000 ImageNet-1k classes. The Mini Imagenet dataset comes from timm (PyTorch Image Models), which is a popular Python library that provides a comprehensive collection of pre-trained computer vision models, particularly focused on image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mini-imagenet dataset on HuggingFace has:\n",
    "* 50,000 training samples\n",
    "* 10,000 validation images\n",
    "* 5,000 test samples (50 samples per class)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `split` parameter in HuggingFace's `load_dataset` function specifies which portion of the dataset to load. You can load a complete split like `split='train'`, `split='validation'`, or `split='test'`. Additionally, you can load just a subset of a split using slice notation - for example, `split='train[:10%]'` will load only the first **10% of the classes in the training data** (i.e. 10 of the 100 classes), which is useful for faster experimentation and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to work with just 10 classes for learning efficiency. To simplify our experiments and ensure balanced class representation, we'll use a helper function `balanced_split` to sample exactly 1000 training images, 200 validation images, and 200 test images, with images distributed evenly between the selected classes (as much as possible). This means each class will contribute an equal number of samples, unless a class has too few images, in which case we'll include all available samples from that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "* We're only using 1000 training images, 200 validation images, and 200 test images for learning purposes. In a real-world scenario, you'd likely use a far larger dataset for training and evaluation :)\n",
    "* Loading the dataset and creating a balanced split may take a couple minutes to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding HuggingFace Dataset Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "HuggingFace datasets are structured like lists of dictionaries, where each element represents one data sample. For image datasets like mini-imagenet, each sample has two key fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`image`**: A PIL Image object. This is the actual image data that can be displayed, transformed, or converted to a numpy array using `np.array(image)`. The images are typically stored in RGB format with pixel values ranging from 0-255.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`label`**: An integer representing the class ID for that image. For example, `label=0` might correspond to \"house_finch\", `label=1` to \"robin\", etc. The mapping between label integers and class names is typically stored in the dataset's features or metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example usage:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Access a single sample\n",
    "sample = mini_imagenet_train[0]\n",
    "print(sample.keys())  # Output: dict_keys(['image', 'label'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the image and label\n",
    "image = sample['image']  # PIL Image object\n",
    "label = sample['label']  # Integer class ID\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert image to numpy array (height, width, channels)\n",
    "image_array = np.array(image)\n",
    "print(image_array.shape)  # e.g., (84, 84, 3) for RGB\n",
    "```"

    "## Question 1b: Prepare the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyTorch Dataset and DataLoaders\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our data, we need to prepare it for model training. When we train machine learning models, we need an efficient way to access our data (often in batches, which are subsets of our data that we pass into our model all at once to take advantage of our computer/server's full computation power). PyTorch's `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes allow us to neatly encapsulate code for processing and accessing our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* PyTorch's `Dataset` class is an abstract class that represents a dataset–it stores the samples and their corresponding labels.\n",
    "* Once we have a `Dataset`, we can pass it into a `DataLoader`, which wraps an iterable around the `Dataset` so we can easily access samples individually or in batches in our training loop.\n",
    "* PyTorch has a great tutorial about `Datasets` and `DataLoaders` you can check out [here](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is PyTorch's `Dataset` class useful?\n",
    "1. `Datasets` can integrate with PyTorch's `DataLoader` objects for batching, shuffling, and parallel loading.\n",
    "2. You have more flexible control over how data is loaded and preprocessed.\n",
    "3. You can encapsulate all data logic in one place, making your training code cleaner.\n",
    "4. The `Dataset` and `Dataloader`'s standard interface means your dataset works with any PyTorch training loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch provides many built-in datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, etc.) through `torchvision.datasets`, but you'll need a custom Dataset when:\n",
    "* Your data has a unique structure, such as being stored in a local folder on your computer.\n",
    "* The data has non-standard formats (e.g. medical imaging, satellite data, audio spectrograms).\n",
    "* You have special loading requirements, like combining data from multiple sources.\n",
    "* You need custom preprocessing logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, since we're loading Mini ImageNet from HuggingFace and subsampling only 10 classes out of it, let's get some hands-on practice making our own custom dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "To create your own custom dataset, you need to inherit from `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and implement three key methods.\n",
    "1. `__init__(self, ...)`\n",
    "    1. This is your custom dataset's constructor! Here, you should save your data, initialize any transforms/preprocessing, and set up any configurations you may need.\n",
    "2. `__len__(self)`\n",
    "    1. Returns the total number of samples in your dataset. This is used by DataLoader to know when to stop iterating.\n",
    "3. `__getitem__(self, idx)`\n",
    "    1. The most important method! Returns a single sample from your dataset at the given index idx. This is where you:\n",
    "        1. Load the actual data (e.g., index from an array, read image from disk).\n",
    "        2. Apply transformations.\n",
    "        3. Return the sample and its label.\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "from torch.utils.data import Dataset\n",
    "\n",

Otherwise, we will need to explicitly make sure that our image is in the correct format (a Tensor with `dtype=torch.float` and shape (C, H, W)) for training our model.\n",
    "        * For this function, you can assume that if we apply the transform, we won't need to apply the other operations to cast the item into a tensor, permute it, and type-cast it because we will provide the standard ImageNet transforms for you later on!\n",
    "    * Otherwise, if the tranform is `None`, you should:\n",
    "        * Convert the item's image into a 3D numeric array.\n",
    "        * Cast the image into a `torch.Tensor` with `dtype=torch.float`.\n",
    "        * Permute the image into the shape (C, H, W).\n",
    "    * Cast the label to a `torch.Tensor` with `dtype=torch.long`.\n",
    "    * Return the transformed image and label.\n",
    "* `show_images`:\n",
    "    * Sample `num_images` random images from the dataset.\n",
    "    * Display the images in a grid layout.\n",
    "    * For each image, use `class_id_to_name` to get a readable class name and set the readable class name as the title of the image.\n",
    "    * You can use matplotlib or plotly to display the images.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "* It might be helpful to refer to the section on \"Understanding HuggingFace Dataset Objects\" to understand how to extract an image and its label from the dataset.\n",
    "* In the `__getitem__` method, we should make sure the item and label we return are both of type `torch.Tensor` and have the correct dtype. If the item and label aren't tensors with the correct dtype, you should:\n",
    "    * Cast the item to `torch.Tensor` with `dtype=torch.float` after the transform is applied.\n",
    "    * Cast the label to `torch.Tensor` with `dtype=torch.long`.\n",
    "    * Note that PyTorch expects the inputs to the models to have `dtype=torch.float` to match the dtype of the model weights, and the labels to have `dtype=torch.long` when we pass them into loss functions.\n",
    "* Make sure that the final tensor your `__getitem__` method returns has the shape (C, H, W) where C = number of channels (usually 3 for R, G, and B), H = image height, and W = image width.\n",
    "    * Images are usually represented as arrays in the shape (H, W, C) but libraries like PyTorch usually expect each image to have shape (C, H, W) to optimize the matrix math that goes on behind the scenes! For instance, when we visualize nd.arrays using Plotly or Matplotlib, your image arrays should have the shape (H, W, C). But when we want to use arrays/tensors to train machine learning models, your image arrays should have the shape (C, H, W).\n",
    "    * [`torch.permute`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.permute.html#torch.permute) might be helpful."

    "## Question 1c: Create Datasets and DataLoaders\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the custom Dataset class we implemented, let's create MiniImageNetDatasets that contain our training and validataion data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Dataset implementation, we specified a `transform` parameter that we can use to apply transformations to our images. For most vision-tasks, we often apply transformations to our images to help the model generalize better.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch has a `transforms` module that contains many built-in transformations you can use. Additionally, we can compose multiple transformations into a single `transforms.Compose` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we'll use the following transformations:\n",
    "* `transforms.Resize`: Resize the image to a smaller size\n",
    "* `transforms.RandomCrop`: Randomly crop the image to a smaller size\n",
    "* `transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip`: Randomly flip the image horizontally\n",
    "* `transforms.ToTensor`: Convert the image to a tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following block, we've defined the standard preprocessing pipeline for ImageNet models:\n",
    "* Resize images to 256 pixels on the shorter side.\n",
    "* Crop to 224×224 (the standard input size for most ImageNet-trained architectures like ResNet).\n",
    "* For training, we use data augmentation with random crops and horizontal flips to help the model generalize better.\n",
    "* For validation we use deterministic center crops to ensure consistent evaluation.\n",
    "* Lastly, we normalize the images using means and standard deviations computed from the entire ImageNet training set. The mean `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and standard deviations `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]` have 3 values, one for each channel (R, G, B). By normalizing our Mini-ImageNet data using these same statistics, we ensure that the pixel value distributions match what models expect if we were to use pretrained ImageNet weights for transfer learning. This normalization also helps with training stability by centering the data around zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Create training and validation instances of our custom dataset class using the appropriate transformations.\n",
    "* Define a `train_dataset` that uses `mini_imagenet_train` as the dataset, `class_id_to_name` as the class_id_to_name, `split=\"train\"`, and `transform=train_transform`.\n",
    "* Define a `val_dataset` that uses `mini_imagenet_val` as the dataset, `class_id_to_name` as the class_id_to_name, `split=\"val\"`, and `transform=val_transform`."

    "## Question 1d: Train your CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "We are ready to train our CNN model! To train our CNN model, we need to write a training loop that passes inputs into our model, updates the weights of our model, and repeats!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important terminology**:\n",
    "* *epoch*: one complete pass through the entire training dataset\n",
    "* *batch*: a subset of samples we pass into the model at the same time\n",
    "* *optimizer*: what kind of optimization algorithm we want to use (e.g. Adam, Momentum)\n",
    "* *criterion*: the loss function we want to use to evaluate our model on\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Loops\n",
    "A training loop is where your model actually learns! Each iteration through the loop, the model:\n",
    "* Makes predictions\n",
    "* Calculates how wrong it was (loss)\n",
    "* Updates its weights to do better next time\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyTorch Training Loops: Step-by-Step Guide and Best Practices\n",
    "1. Setup - Move model to device\n",
    "    1. It's a good practice to begin by moving your model to the device (either `cuda` aka GPU or `cpu`). Your model and data must be on the same device. Moving the model to the GPU can speed up training.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> model.to(device)  # device = 'cuda' or 'cpu'\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Outer Loop - Iterate for `num_epochs` epochs\n",
    "    1. Models rarely learn perfectly in one pass. Multiple epochs let the model see the data repeatedly and gradually improve.\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n",
    ">    # An epoch = one complete pass through the entire training dataset\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Set the model to training mode before passing in training data\n",
    "    1. Some layers (Dropout, BatchNorm) behave differently during training vs testing.\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">model.train()\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inner loop - Iterate over training batches\n",
    "    1. Process data in batches to make the most of your GPU's computational power without overflowing memory.\n",
    "    2. Move the data to the same device as the model, and if needed, cast them to the appropriate dtypes.\n",
    "        1. Data should have the same dtype as your model's parameters.\n",
    "        2. Usually, loss functions expect the target labels to have `dtype=torch.long`.\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">for x, y in train_dataloader:\n",
    ">    # Process one batch at a time\n",
    ">    x = x.to(device, dtype=torch.float)\n",
    ">    y = y.to(device, dtype=torch.long)\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Zero out the gradients - PyTorch accumulates gradients by default. If you don't reset them, old gradients will add to new ones, causing wrong updates! **Always** zero out the gradients BEFORE the forward pass of each batch.\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">optimizer.zero_grad()\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Make a forward pass to get your model's predictions on the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">y_hat = model(x)\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Compute the loss between your predictions and the target labels\n",
    "    1. Loss measures how wrong your predictions are. Lower loss = better predictions.\n",
    "    2. The criterion will return a single number representing the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">loss = criterion(y_hat, y)\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Backward pass to compute gradients\n",
    "    1. Call `loss.backward()` to compute gradients for each learnable weight in your model.\n",
    "9. Update the weights\n",
    "    1. Call `optimizer.step()` to update the weights in your model based on the gradients computed during backpropagation!\n",
    "10. Track training metrics (optional but a good practice!)\n",
    "    1. Track the training loss and training accuracy\n",
    "    2. Since loss is a `torch.Tensor`, we can get its scalar value by calling `loss.item()`. Otherwise, we can't directly add a `torch.Tensor` (even if it's just a one-dimensional scalar!) to another Python primitive like `train_loss`, which might be a Python float.\n",
    "    3. In multi-class classification, the model's output `y_hat` will be an array of length `num_classes` where each element is the probability that the given data point belongs to that class. To get the class with the highest probablity, we can call `argmax` (returns the index corresponding the maximum value). Remember that we are using batches in our training loop! So `y_hat` will be a tensor of shape (batch_size, num_classes). By specifying `dim=1`, we can get the predicted class for each item in the batch. So `preds` will have shape (batch_size, 1) --> one predicted class for each item in the batch.\n",
    "    4. To compute the training accuracy, we can check when the predicted class equals the actual true targets `y` and sum up all the correct predictions. Since `preds` and `y` are both tensors, the expression `(preds == y)` and the sum is also a `torch.Tensor`. So similarly to the loss, we can get the scalar value of this tensor by calling `.item()`.\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">train_loss += loss.item()  # Accumulate loss\n",
    ">preds = torch.argmax(y_hat, dim=1)  # Get predicted class for each item in the batch\n",
    ">train_correct += (preds == y).sum().item()  # Count correct predictions\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Measure validation metrics after each epoch\n",
    "    1. Set the model to `eval` mode - Disables dropout, uses running stats for BatchNorm, etc.\n",
    "    2. Make predictions on the validation data, and measure validation loss and/or accuracy.\n",
    "    3. **Important note:** Make sure to do all your validation under a `with torch.no_grad()` header! This tells PyTorch not to keep track of forward pass operations or compute gradients during this code block. This saves memory and speeds up validation because we don't want to train the model during validation–we want to measure how it's performing.\n",

    "### How we calculate average loss and accuracy\n",
    "* When we train a model, we want to report the average loss and average accuracy for each epoch, not just the total. This helps us understand how well the model is performing per sample, and lets us compare results across different epochs and experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss Calculation**\n",
    "* During each epoch, for each batch we encounter, we add the loss computed over all items in the batch to the total loss: `train_loss += loss.item()`.\n",
    "* At the end of the epoch, we divide by the number of batches: `train_loss /= len(train_dataloader)`.\n",
    "* Each batch's loss is an average over the samples in that batch, so dividing by the number of batches gives us the average loss per batch for the whole epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy Calculation**\n",
    "* We count the total number of correct predictions for all samples in the epoch: `train_correct += (preds == targets).sum().item()`.\n",
    "* At the end of the epoch, we divide by the total number of samples in the dataset: `train_acc = train_correct / len(train_dataloader.dataset)`.\n",
    "* This gives us the fraction of samples the model predicted correctly (i.e., the overall accuracy for the epoch).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following block, we've implemented a training loop for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** `tqdm` is a Python library used to display progress bars. In the `train` function we've implemented, we use it as a wrapper around iterators such as the dataloaders so that we can track the progress of how many epochs we've trained for. It's a nice-to-have, but when you implement your own training loops in the future, you can also simply iterate through the dataloaders like in the simplified example above too."

    "\n",
    "Deep neural networks can be incredibly powerful and expressive, but they can also be difficult to train! There are a few problems that deep neural networks encounter:\n",
    "* Vanishing gradients: Earlier layers receive very small gradients because the upstream gradients get multiplied by many local gradients. Thus, during gradient descent, their weights move by very small amounts and they don't \"learn\" as effectively.\n",
    "* Accuracy degradation: Adding more layers to a deep model causes accuracy to saturate, contributing to higher *training error* and *test error* compared to a shallower network with less layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization can help address the vanishing gradient problem. But accuracy degradation can still persist in deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Residual Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2015, He et al. proposed a solution to the degradation problem by introducing the concept of **residual learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385) Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks can be thought of as being composed of many different \"blocks\", which are just 1 or more layers (e.g. linear layers, activation functions, convolution layers, etc.) we think of as a single group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we can view the blocks in our neural networks as functions mapping some input $x$ to some output $z$ (note that $z$ might not be the final output of our neural network like a class prediction, but could also be the input into another hidden layer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote the ground truth function we want this block in our neural network to learn as $f$, where $f(x) = z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of forcing the layer(s) in our block to learn $f(x)$, we let them learn another mapping $g(x)$ where $g(x) = f(x) - x$. Then, we can \"add in\" our original input $x$ to the output of $g(x)$ to achieve our desired mapping $f(x)$!\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors showed that with **residual learning**:\n",
    "1. Deep residual networks were easier to optimize than deep networks without residual connections\n",
    "2. Residual networks demonstrate significant accuracy gains even as they get deeper, avoiding the degradation problem\n",
    "3. They were able to win 1st place awards in the ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization,\n",
    "COCO detection, and COCO segmentation in ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Residual Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask why we want to do this! Aren't we just trying to learn some other function $g(x)$ now? Why are we complicating things by subtracting $x$ from $f(x)$ if we have to add it back in anyways?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few intuitions behind why the ResNet architecture is very powerful!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason 1:** Adding a residual connection lets more of the upstream gradient flow backwards\n",
    "\n",
    "> Imagine layer N, whose input is $x$ and whose output is $z$. Denote the upstream gradient that backpropagates from the loss $L$ to the current layer N as $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial z}$. Without a residual connection, the downstream gradient layer N propagates down to layer N - 1 is: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial z} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> With a residual connection, the downstream gradient that layer N propagates down to layer N - 1 is now $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial z} \\cdot (\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} + 1)$. Thus, even if the local gradient term $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}$ is very small, the + 1 ensures that gradients don't vanish completely and allow information to flow backwards more effectively!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason 2:** Blocks can learn residual mappings!\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Pxbe1Op.jpeg\" alt=\"Residual Block\" width=\"400\"/>\n",

    "Let's zoom in on a block of a neural network (outlined by a the dotted box), with input $x$. We assume that $f(x)$, the desired ground truth mapping we want the block to learn, will be used as the input to the activation function at the top. The \"weight layers\" represented by the white rectangles can be fully connected linear layers or convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left, we have a block without a residual connection. The dotted-line box must directly learn $f(x)$. On the right, the layers in the dotted-line box have to learn the **residual mapping** $g(x) = f(x) - x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the actual desired function we want to learn is the identity function ($f(x) = x$), then the residual mapping is just $g(x) = 0$ very easy for the layers on the right to learn–we just need to push the weights and biases of the \"weight layer\" to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, sometimes, a neural network has already learned everything it needs from its data to perform its task! Adding additional layers is like forcing the network to keep \"squeezing\" more information out from the data. Using a residual connection lets a network block decide whether or not it might be more effective to simply pass only $x$ forward, without applying additional non-linearities onto it."

    "## Question 2a: Implement a Residual Block in PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Use PyTorch to instantiate a Residual Block with the following architecture:\n",
    "> * Convolution layer 1 with 64 channels, 3x3 kernel, padding = 1, stride = 1 (set stride = 2 if downsampling)\n",
    "> * Batchnorm\n",
    "> * ReLU activation\n",

    "> * Batchnorm\n",
    "> * Residual AKA skip connection\n",
    "> * ReLU activation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes about downsampling:**\n",
    "* **Downsampling** refers to reducing the size of the feature map. For instance, let's say our original input to this layer was a 28 x 28 image. We can downsample it to a 14 x 14 image, essentially halving the H and W. Downsampling is often combined with an increase in the number of output channels. The main benefits of downsampling are 1) reducing computation, 2) increasing the receptive field of the output units (i.e. how many input pixels each output unit \"looks\" at), and 3) enabling hierarchical feature learning (i.e. letting the model learn fine details at high resolutions, then reducing the resolution by making the input that gets passed down to later layers of a smaller size so that the model can learn bigger-picture details at a lower resolution). Many ResNet implementations downsample the input in the first convolution layer. Downsampling can be implemented by using a stride of 2 instead of a stride of 1 in a Conv2d layer. This means the kernel will shift over by 2 pixels each time instead of 1.\n",
    "* When downsampling, we can't directly add the input to the output of the convolution layers anymore because the dimensions won't match! Instead, we can also perform downsampling during the skip connection by applying a 1x1 convolution with stride=2 on the skip connection to match the shape of the convolution output before adding them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "1. Use separate batchnorm layers after each convolution layer!\n",
    "2. `BatchNorm2d` normalizes each channel independently over the batch and spatial dimensions, so it needs one $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ per channel. When initializing a `BatchNorm2d` layer, you should pass in the number of input channels as the `num_features` argument.\n",
    "3. The residual connection and the output of the 2 convolutions should have the same shape (i.e. the same C, H, and W dimensions). What is the shape of the output after the 2 convolutions?\n",
    "    1. To make sure the dimensions match, you can apply a 1x1 convolution to the input $x$. Think about how a 1x1 convolution affects the H, W of the input, and how you can modify it to match the C dimension of the convolution output.\n",
    "4. If we want to downsample an image, we typically apply a stride of 2 in the first conv layer. If `initial_downsample = True`, make sure to adjust the stride in your conv layers in the `__init__` method appropriately! Also make sure to use a stride of 2 in the residual connection if we downsample.\n",

    "1. `nn.Sequential` is a very helpful PyTorch class when we need to group together many layers that we want to apply one after another. Try using `nn.Sequential` to group together different blocks in each stage! You can find the docs and examples for `nn.Sequential` [here](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Sequential.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Note that the stages are composed of multiple residual blocks in sequence. In the ResNet-18 implementation, whenever we want to downsample or change the number of channels, we do that in the first residual block of each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You can use AdaptiveAvgPool2d to get a 1x1 feature map for the final fully-connected layer without having to specify the input_size, kernel_size, stride, padding, etc. explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You can use nn.Flatten() to flatten the output of the global average pooling layer to a 1D value for each channel."

    "The Transformer Architecture (source: Machine Learning Mastery)\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Like ResNets, Transformers are another architecture innovation that *transformed* the world of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers were first invented for sequence-to-sequence applications, such as machine translation. In sequence-to-sequence applications, we want to take one sequence (e.g. English words) and output another sequence (e.g. its French translation).\n",
    "\n",
    "In early seq2seq models, the entire input was compressed by an encoder into a single fixed-length vector (called the context vector). Then, this single context vector was fed into a decoder which would produce an output. [RNNs (recurrent neural networks)](https://d2l.ai/chapter_recurrent-neural-networks/index.html) improved this idea by processing data step by step, and passing information along through hidden vectors. But they struggled to capture long-range contexts and took a long time to train because they had to process each input token sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers solved this problem by using *attention*. The intution behind attention is we sometimes want to dynamically *attend* to only the most important parts of the input---or of the output we have generated so far---when we want to predict what should come next in our output sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "So how exactly do you determine which parts of your sequence are most relevant to each other?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we can use dot products to compute how similar 2 vectors are to each other! The higher the value of two vectors' dot product, the more 'similar' they are to each other/the closer they are to each other in vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Transformers use a mechanism called *scaled dot-product attention* to implement attention:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\\frac{Q K^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}) V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each position in the input, the model computes three vectors: a query vector $q$, a key vector $k$, and a value vector $v$. We can stack the query, key, and value vectors into matrices $Q$, $K$, $V$, where the i-th row of $Q$ corresponds to the query vector $q_i$ of the i-th token in the sequence, etc.\n",
    "* These vectors are learned linear projections of the input embeddings.\n",
    "    * A helpful analogy for understanding the role that the query, key, and value vectors play is thinking about going to the library! The *query* represents what you are searching for (for instance, you might be looking for a book about matrix calculus). The *keys* for each book in the library are their titles---you use this to judge how relevant the  content in the book might be to your search. And the *value* of each library book is the actual content inside.\n",
    "* To determine how much attention to pay to each part of the input, the model takes the dot product between the query vector of the current position and the key vectors of all positions in the sequence. This produces a set of scores that measure the similarity or relevance between the current position and every other position. We can represent taking dot products between all the query vectors and key vectors all at once as the matrix multiplication of $Q K^T$. The $i$-th row of the matrix product $Q K^T$ represents how similar the $i$-th query vector was to all the key vectors. Specifically, the $i, j$-th entry represents how 'similar' the $i$-th token was to the $j$-th token.\n",
    "* Then, these scores are divided by the square root of the key dimension $d_k$ (to prevent their variance from growing too large), and passed through a softmax function.\n",
    "* The softmax turns the scores into a probability distribution, so that all attention weights for a given token in the sequence sum to one. In other words, if you were to sum the attention weights across a single row, they would all sum up to 1. Remember that the $i$-th row corresponds to the attention weights for the $i$-th input token! So we are simply re-scaling the 'similarity scores' in each row/for each input token.\n",
    "* Finally, these weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the value vectors for each position. In matrix notation, this is represented by multiplying the $softmax$ matrix by $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is another matrix which represents the attention output for all positions in the sequence---you can think of this matrix as telling us how much each input token should \"attend\" to every other token!\n",
    "\n",
    "This process allows the model to dynamically focus on the most relevant parts of the input when making predictions, and is the core building block of the Transformer architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encoders and Decoders\n",
    "Transformers consist of 2 main parts, which both use attention but in slightly different ways!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoder\n",
    "The encoder takes in the original input sequence and produces a vector for each input position that encodes information about that token based on the context of the entire input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder is a stack of identical layers. Each layer has:\n",
    "1. **Self-Attention:** Lets every token attend to all other tokens in the input to gather global context.\n",
    "2. Position-wise Feed-Forward Network (two linear layers with a nonlinearity).\n",
    "3. Residual connections and LayerNorm around both sublayers to stabilize training and ease gradient flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoder\n",
    "The decoder generates outputs autoregressively (which means it generates the next token based on previous tokens it has already outputted)\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder is also a stack of identical layers, but each layer has three sublayers:\n",
    "1. **Masked Self-Attention:** tokens from the output sequence attend to one another. The query, key, and value vectors all come from the decoder. We also apply a causal (look-ahead) mask in the decoder self-attention, which prevents a position from attending to future target tokens. During training, we pass in the entire target sequence to the decoder so we want to make sure the decoder can't \"cheat\" by looking ahead at future tokens when trying to predict them.\n",
    "2. **Cross-Attention:** tokens from the output sequence also attend to the encoder's output, \"enriching\" vectors in the decoder with useful information from the encoder. The query vectors come from the decoder, and the keys/values come from the encoder.\n",
    "3. Position-wise Feed-Forward Network\n",
    "4. Each sublayer is wrapped with residual connections and LayerNorm.\n",

    "1. Causal Masking (Look-Ahead Mask) prevent future information leakage. In decoder-only models (like GPT) and the decoder portion of encoder-decoder models, we need to ensure that when predicting token at position $i$, the model can only atten to tokens at positions $\\leq i$ and not future positions.\n",
    "    1. Why? - During training, we have access to the entire sequence, but at inference time, we generate tokens one at a time and don't know future tokens yet\n",
    "    2. Without masking, the model would \"cheat\" by looking at future tokens during training. This creates a mismatch between training and inference behavior\n",

    ">  ✓ \"sat\"\n",
    ">  ✗ \"on\"  (future token - must be masked)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Padding Mask - When batching sequences of different lengths, we sometimes pad shorter sequences with special tokens. We need to mask these padding positions so the model doesn't attend to meaningless values.\n",
    "    1. Why? - Padding tokens have no semantic meaning, so they shouldn't influence what the model attends to. We mask [PAD] tokens so they receive zero attention weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Batch of 2 sequences:\n",

    "1. Implement the `scaled_dot_product_attention` function which computes the scaled dot product attention of $Q$, $K$, and $V$.\n",
    "2. If `mask` is not None, use `masked_fill` to fill all values where `mask = True` with `float(-'inf')`.\n",
    "3. Use the `softmax` function you implemented above to compute the softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",

    "`d_ffn` is the hidden/inner width of the FFN (the expansion dimension). Generally, `d_ffn` is chosen to be `4 * d_model`. After the first linear layer \"expands\" each vector from dimension `d_model` to `d_ffn`, the second linear layer \"shrinks\" the expanded vector back down to `d_model` so that it can be passed to the next `EncoderLayer` or to the Decoder.\n",

    "You might ask, why would we expand the dimensions up to `d_ffn` if we're just going to shrink it back down to `d_model` again? The reason is that generally, vectors in higher-dimensions can encode more diverse types of information. We're sort of giving the FFN a chance to learn additional information about the vectors in this new, bigger feature space that it can then compress into a more useful vector even back in a feature space with only `d_model` dimensions.\n",

    "### Important note on decoder-only architectures\n",
    "For tasks where we only need to generate the next token given the sequence so far (e.g. text generation), we only need a decoder-only architecture. In a decoder-only architecture, the decoder takes in only `x` and no encoder output. The decoder passes `x` through its masked self-attention layers but skips the cross-attention altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original encoder + decoder architecture was designed for translation tasks, where the source and target sequence come from different languages. In this homework, we will be using our transformer to generate new text based on a collection of short stories. Our training data will be a collection of word sequences, and the goal of the transformer will be to predict the next word at every position. At training, we pass an entire input sequence into the model. The model tries to predict what the next word should be for every position in the sequence at once. So during training, even if we mask the decoder's self-attention to keep it from \"peeking\" into the future as it makes predictions at a given sequence, information from future tokens might still leak back to the decoder if it uses cross-attention. The decoder would then be able to attend to the *entirety* of the encoder output sequence in cross-attention, which will contain information from all the tokens in the input sequence including the ones that the decoder is trying to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for cases where the transformer will be used purely as a decoder-only model, we need to skip the cross-attention step. We can implement this by skipping the `cross_attention` layer if `encoder_output` is `None`.\n",

    "\n",
    "We need to create targets to train our transformer and measure how well it performs at next-token prediction. You might have noticed that our dataset earlier didn't come with any labels... but that's okay because we already have everything we need! In our case, we want to train our transformer to predict the next token. So if we pass in everything up until the $i$-th token of our input to the transformer, we want to see how close our transformer gets to predicting that the next token should be the $i+1$-th token of the story!\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is that for training a transformer on next-token prediction, the inputs and the targets are the same sequence but shifted over by 1 position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "* Let's say we have the sentence: \"Dinosaur nuggets taste great with ketchup.\"\n",
    "* If we pass in the token \"with\" to the transformer, the *target* of its output is the actual next word in the sentence: \"ketchup\"\n",
    "* So each training and target pair looks like the same sequence shifted by one.\n",

    "    1. Note: We could have also chosen to pad shorter sequences, but for this homework we'll just skip over paragraphs that are too short\n",
    "5. For all sequences of length `max_seq_length` in this paragraph, append it to the `input` array and append the sequence that comes 1 index position after to the `target` array\n",

    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",

    "Our tiny transformer should now be ready to produce some of its own tiny stories! We've defined a function below that can be used to autoregressively generate new tokens from the transformer given a starting prompt. Feel free to play around with the `max_seq_len`, `max_length`, and `prompt` to see what stories you can generate with your transformer! The transformer may not be able to produce fully fluent sentences yet, but hopefully you see some coherence in the new stories it outputs.\n",

    "**Note:** Because the transformer's final output is a vector of class probabilities, we can get the ID of the next token it predicts by applying an `argmax` over the final output vector. To map this token ID back into a word, we can \"flip\" our dictionary which mapped words to ids into one that maps ids to words. Then, we can add this newly generated word to our tiny story so far, and keep sampling the next token from the transformer, ad infinitum!"
